          "reviewBody": "This book moved me in ways I didn’t think possible. Mythology is not a subject I’m fond  of, and I was intimidated that the complicated cast of famous characters would distract me trying to keep the relationships straight. But, I was proven wrong. Miller weaves her story beautifully and makes it easy to draw connections between the gods, mortals and monsters. Circe is more than a retelling of an age old tale, it’s a coming of age - a story of realizing ones true purpose as a witch, a woman, a daughter and a mother exiled to learn about herself and her relationships through a series of adventures. Relatable in ways I didn’t expect, I highly recommend this.",
