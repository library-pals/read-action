About five hundred miles of driving, I’d say. \nI like that it’s fairly hardcore sci-fi with no dragons, magic or swords. The plot? Two heroines battle for control of Time until they finally realize they are in love with each other, and run off together leaving someone else to figure out how to deal with Time. This story seems to really be a metaphor for certain situations in life, perhaps. The author likes to build very descriptive passages which I enjoyed. There is no actual racy or sexual content.",
