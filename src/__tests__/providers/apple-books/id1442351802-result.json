The themes and lessons of Circe are as timeless as the myths themselves, yet ever more potent in as time goes on. Madeline Miller has indeed succeeded in providing the world with an Odyssey tale, much fuller than its predecessor and with infinitely more wisdom of human nature and the dark night of the soul. Oh to be witch of Aiaia.",

I related to her so much and found myself inspired and empowered by her and her story. I love this adaptation so much. I love Circe and thank you Madeline Miller!!! The audiobook is even better, just because the narrator is amazing and I just love hearing someone else reading her story.",
